## What is it for?

This program makes recurrent calls of the PlayStore application pages, parses them and informs by email or Telegram if they have new versions. In some cases it could be useful.
All this changes are stored in database.  
And this program helps me to try some new technologies and approaches:
- Spring Boot
- AngularJS
- MongoDB
- Spring-data
- gradle
- groovy config
- Jsoup
- yml-properties
- scheduled tasks
- And internal libraries for: 
    - Telegram API 
    - MongoDB initialization, testing
