## What is it for?

This program makes recurrent calls of the PlayStore application pages, parses them and informs when they changes versions by email or Telegram. In some cases it could be useful.
All this changes are stored in database.  
And this program helps me to try some new technologies and approaches:
- Spring Boot
- groovy config
- Spring-data
- MongoDB
- Jsoup
- And internal libraries for: 
    - Telegram API 
    - MongoDB initialization
